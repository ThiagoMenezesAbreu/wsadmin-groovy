A value of "METADATA" indicates that only the metadata portion of the asset file is to be stored.  The metadata portion of a jar file, for example, would include files under the "META-INF" directory. Depending on the type of jar file, metadata might include other directories, also.  A value of "NONE" indicates that no part of the asset file is to be saved.  If the storage type is "NONE", the metadata for the asset must be available through the destination URI when it is configured as a composition unit. The default storage type is that set by the asset's content handler.
